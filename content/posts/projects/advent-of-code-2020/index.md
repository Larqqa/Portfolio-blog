I wanted to try out my skills at rapid problem solving and adaptation to new programming languages. I decided to do Advent Of Code with a new language everyday. I picked out 25 different languages, for 25 days of the challenge and got to work.
The hardest parts for this project were days with functional programming. I haven't touched functional languages that much before and I was not at all comfortable with the paradigm.
I found this challenge to be super fun and rewarding in the end. I got to try out some new languages and have some projects lined up with some new skills and interests I gathered during this project.

Full list of languages I used:
* Day 1: C
* Day 2: Rust
* Day 3: Java
* Day 4: Go
* Day 5: Ruby
* Day 6: Elixir
* Day 7: C#
* Day 8: Haskell
* Day 9: Kotlin
* Day 10: C++
* Day 11: Clojure
* Day 12: OCaml
* Day 13: bash
* Day 14: Python
* Day 15: Lua
* Day 16: Raku
* Day 17: TypeScript
* Day 18: Elisp
* Day 19: Julia
* Day 20: Nim
* Day 21: Scala
* Day 22: PHP
