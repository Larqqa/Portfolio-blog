# PHP REST API

![RESTAPI](./RESTAPI.png)

This is a simple REST API I made in PHP and React.
The project uses Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend, and a JSON file as a mockup database.
The projects purpose was to try making the backend with PHP, as i had been making a lot of Express based backends.
