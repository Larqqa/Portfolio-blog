# ASTEROIDS

![asteroids](./asteroids.png)

My interpretation of the classic game, asteroids. This was made using vanilla JavaScript.
There is also an electron based desktop version in the repo!

This is one of my earlier projects using JavaScript. The most difficulty I had with this project was the positioning and movements of all the game elements, and the interactions between these elements.
