This is a Color Picker app made with Java. This app uses the AWT library for the graphics.
The concept is the same as other color pickers, but this allows you to pick the color from your desktop.
You can get the color from anything you can point your mouse at.
The app gives you the color as RGB-, HSV- and HEX-colors, for a wide range of options.
Some hacky solutions were needed to make the window stay on top of the desktop after picking a color.
