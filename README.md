# This is my new portfolio

## This is the source code for my new portfolio/blog webapp

This will be my portfolio/blog using github pages. The blog will have some cool stuff iv'e done and discovered, that i think should be shared among the community.


## WIP:
* Animated background
* card based project showcase
* Project list page
* About page
* work experience
* blog


The markdown files can have a header. This header should be of the format
```
---
"title": "the title"
"date": "dd-mm-yyyy"
"categories": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
---
```
